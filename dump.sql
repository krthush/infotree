This course was introduced in 2013-14 as a means of bridging quantitative approaches common to analysis to support qualitative decisions in design.  The purpose, simply stated, is to make students conversant in key mathematical techniques as applied to system design.  In this context, we define a design optimisation problem as one where the \'best\' solution must be chosen from a range of potential options.  As each option may be modeled as a variable, the course introduces empirical measures to find the \'best\' combination for variables for the design.  The course is presented in nine learning modules, outlined below.  \r\n\r\n In this folder you will find general information on the course, its learning outcomes, syllabus, grading scheme, and student feedback from previous sessions.\r\n\r\nCourse Overview\r\nThe purpose of the unit is to introduce the concept of mathematical optimization as applied to system design.  Design, in this context, is viewed in the broad sense capturing problems ranging from engineering (technical) design, to plant operations, to complex processes such as civil planning and infrastructure, to financial modelling.  The course aims at providing students with a first exposure to a rational integration of design methodologies with concepts and techniques of modern optimization theory and practice.  The goal is to enable modelling of constraints and processes in system design such that single and multivariate optimization may be performed to focus on critical measures of performance.   It will stress rigorous, quantitative multidisciplinary design methodology that works with the non-quantitative and creative side of the design process. The objective of the course is to present tools and methodologies for performing system optimization in a multidisciplinary design context. Focus will be on all: (i) the multidisciplinary character of engineering systems, (ii) the creation of reasonable models of such systems, and (iii) tools for optimization, with emphasis on software and numerical analysis.  Students will complete the course conversant with techniques in practice to create appropriate mathematical optimization models and to use analytical and computational techniques to solve them\r\n\r\nAims\r\nThe learning aims of this course include:\r\n\r\nTo introduce the concept and theory of mathematical optimisation.\r\nTo demonstrate the practical use of optimisation in a range of system design problems from engineering (technical) design to complex processes such as civil planning and infrastructure and financial modelling, including non-quantitative and creative aspects of the design process.\r\nTo acquaint students with modelling techniques and solution methods and software to implement them.\r\n\r\nLearning Outcomes\r\nAt the end of the course students should be able to: \r\nFormulate precise engineering problems from ambiguous sources in design\r\nReview relevant literature related to engineering principles and discern critical issues relevant to design problems\r\nImplement mathematical optimization tools in engineering design\r\nFormulate systems engineering problems as mathematical optimization formulations\r\nCharacterize, model, formulate, and solve engineering and/or technical problems such that mathematical tools of optimization may be applied for comparison of key performance parameters.\r\nUtilize programming languages such as Xcel and Matlab to solve convex optimization problems\r\nUndertake research, design, development, procurement, operation and/or maintenance in scientific and/or technical engineering fields in optimization and design\r\nArticulate the impact of engineering and/or technical solutions in global context\r\nInteract with personnel from industry, laboratories, academic institutions and/or other services regarding system design, maintenance, and operation\r\n\r\nTarget Audience\r\nIt is the purpose of this course to introduce system optimization in the context of design.  Students will complete the course conversant in the basic principles necessary to utilize domain knowledge in their area of interest to create models for design optimization in that field, and to implement them in software for critical trade-off comparison. This course is intended for system designers, engineers, program acquisition professionals, analysts and others who need to understand how to think in a “big picture” way for system development using systems engineering and analysis methods in synergy with basic optimization tools.  The material is targeted at students without prior knowledge of optimization who wish to apply optimization in practical design situations or who may pursue advanced research work. The treatment of topics is mathematically rigorous but with an emphasis on practical use. \r\n\r\nTeaching Methods\r\nStudents will receive lectures, reading assignments, and four homework assignments (ranging from discussion board participation to programming/simulation exercises) each week for 11 weeks.  Within this period they are expected to consolidate and enhance the lecture material with private study.  The primary focus of the course is the implementation of optimization models in engineering design, thus an emphasis will be place on coursework.  A final exam will also be incorporated into grading.\r\nLecture notes will be provided throughout the course as they pertain to each lecture.  These notes are divided into sections reflecting the structure of the course in general and the chronology of the lectures.  Each section gives some background, detail and limited worked examples to enable the student to enhance his or her personal learning experience both in the lecture room and outside it. \r\n\r\nLecture Delivery\r\nThe course will consist of 10 2-hour lectures (including problem solving sessions).  There is an optional 1 hour problem solving session (added this year based on feedback from previous years) every 2 weeks as well, though class time will be spent on example problems.\r\n  \r\nCoursework\r\nThere will be 4 pieces of coursework through the term, assigned in Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9.  The first will be to review current literature and participate in an on-line discussion with the class, while the following 3 will involve simulations for solving optimization problems.   Individual written feedback will be provided for each coursework assignment.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\nThere are no prerequisites for the course, however past student feedback has indicated that a strong proficiency in Matlab and comfort-level with linear algebra and differential equations are very important to the course.  Students without this proficiency will need to spend more time in the early stages of the course in independent study on these topics.  Students are encouraged to contact the instructor if they have any questions as to their background for taking the course.',1,'2017-11-19 13:00:09','2017-11-19 13:05:16'),(123,'Course Material',1,5,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-19 13:00:23','2017-11-19 13:00:23'),(124,'Panopto Lectures',1,5,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-19 13:00:31','2017-11-19 13:00:31'),(125,'Topic 1: Introduction to Systems Design',1,5,0,1,'Any one who has passed through the regular gradations of a classical education, and is not made a fool by it, may consider himself as having had a very narrow escape. … Memory .. is the chief faculty called into play, in conning over and repeating lessons by rote .. so that he who has the most of this technical memory, with the least turn for other things, .., will make the most forward school-boy.\r\n\r\n- William Hazlitt (1778-1830), in “On the Ignorance of the Learned”\r\n\r\nTopic 1, hopefully setting the stage for conceptual thinking as opposed to recap, will begin with a review of design, then introduce basic concepts in systems architecting and systems thinking as they relate to engineering.

This will be done through the introduction of second order systems, which can be used to capture a very wide range of systems, engineering or otherwise.  We will introduce state space models (which will hopefully look familiar), continue with our work on creating mathematical models from descriptive problems, and move forward with mathematical definitions of critical system characteristics (linearity, causality, etc.).

As discussed to date, existing search procedures for optimization problems may be divided into three main categories: calculus-based, enumerative, and heuristic .  Calculus-based procedures use either analytical or numeric models of the solution space as the basis for the search.  Enumerative or “brute force” procedures search systematically and do not incorporate any sophisticated methods to reduce the problem space or refine proposed solutions.  Heuristic procedures attempt to improve on the search efficiency of enumerative methods without direct incorporation of models of the solution space, which are often unavailable.\r\n\r\nA class of heuristic searching methods based upon simulated evolution, known broadly as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has become popular recently for discrete optimization problems characterized by many local minima in nondifferentiable, discontinuous or constrained problem spaces.  These techniques are population oriented; successive populations of feasible solutions are generated in a stochastic manner following laws similar to that of natural selection.  This contrasts with standard techniques that normally follow a single trajectory repeatedly until a satisfactory solution is reached.  In the evolutionary approach, multiple stochastic solution trajectories proceed simultaneously through processing interactions mimicking genetic exchange, thus progressing towards one or more regions of the search space.  These approaches are justified by the fact that a population-oriented algorithm will automatically store time-sampled replicas of the profile for the function being optimized, providing important clues to its global structure.\r\n\r\nEvolutionary approaches work well when calculus based solutions may become trapped within local minima and objective functions do not have differentiable models of problem spaces or are characterized by sharp discontinuities.  They also work well when a variety of optimization criteria or allow changes in these standards without changing the characteristics of the planner or the search map.  Evolutionary approaches, on the other hand, can handle a variety of optimization goals and are very tolerant to the form of the evaluation function.  Functions to be optimized need not be differentiable or continuous; evolutionary path planning approaches are flexible to changes in the environment and are robust to uncertainties, making them well suited to multiconstraint optimization problems. \r\n\r\nThere are a very wide range and breadth of approaches in implementing evolutionary optimization techniques.  The goal of this topic is to introduce you to these and begin to become comfortable with the concept of population based optimization.

Like most other things in design (and in life) there is not a single are many ways to do things right.\r\n\r\n1 – The \"flow of the report\": It should not be difficult for the reader to understand the text. The relationships between parts of the report should be obvious. There will be unavoidable situations where this will not be self-evident, so explain how this fits and why you are switching direction.\r\n\r\n2 – Structure and organisation: We are looking to see that you understand the correct design process, we are not expecting a chronological account. Write the report in a logical order!\r\n\r\n3 – Figures, Diagrams and Tables: Discuss and Explain. Do not expect the reader to conclude exactly what you intended to communicate, but explain what the diagram shows and what the reader should conclude.\r\n\r\n4 – Figures, Diagrams and Tables – 2: These need captions and should be referenced from the text, even if that is a single line that states \"Table 2 illustrates XYZ\". However, it is unlikely that that is all that needs to be said – see point 3, above. Additionally, please make sure the cross referencing is numeric and correct (i.e. “as shown in figure 1”). Note also that statements such as \"as shown in the figure below\" is rather pointless, because unless this is the last page, there will be many figures “below”.\r\n\r\n5 – Images: Make sure that these are clear, with the relevant dimensions, resolution and contrast. An example from previous years was a thumbnail of an A4 page with the statement \"figure 4 shows how the design process progressed\". It does not because (a) the image only shows a small collection of blurred pixels and (b) I won’t necessarily understand your reasoning… discuss and explain!\r\n\r\n6 – Appendices: An appendix is a piece of information that adds to a report but is not necessary for the understanding of that report. The Litmus test is to imagine that, before the reader reads the report, they will tear off the appendices and throw them in the bin. Does the report still work? If not, then it needs reworking.\r\n\r\n7 – Make sure that the final copy flows properly - see point 1 above! Then proofread it. Then have someone else proofread it, then proof read it again!\r\n\r\n8 - The page limit can be quite restrictive and discussion and explanation is important. This means you will need to keep things concise. Don’t state the obvious, don\'t say the same thing twice in different ways and don’t use 100 words when 20 will do.',1,'2017-11-19 18:36:19','2017-11-20 12:59:54'),(329,'Resit & SQT',1,13,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-19 18:36:31','2017-11-19 18:36:31'),(330,'ME1 information and notes',1,327,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-19 19:10:20','2017-11-19 19:10:20'),(331,'CAD models',1,327,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-19 19:10:31','2017-11-19 19:10:31'),(332,'Scooter feedback',1,327,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-19 19:10:41','2017-11-19 19:10:41'),(333,'Additional information regarding mechanism and handtools',1,328,0,1,'Design Guidance for Injection Mouldings\r\n\r\nFor injection moulding, the following basic rules can be used as a rule of thumb:\r\n\r\nUse a uniform wall thickness throughout the moulded part. This will minimise any issues, such as sinking and warping and facilitate filling of the mould and reduce the cycle time.\r\nUse large radii. The inside radius should be at least the same as the material thickness, if not more\r\nChoose the minimum thickness that matches all requirements of the part, i.e. process, material, and product design. This ensures rapid cooling, short cycle times and minimum mass - so minimum part cost.\r\nDesign the product so that it enables easy withdrawal from the mould: use a draft angle (taper) in the direction of motion of the mould when opening and closing.\r\n\r\nRibs will improve the stiffness of the component, thus avoiding the need to use thick sections (and thus mass, material costs and cycle time costs)\r\n\r\nCommonly used design elements in injection mouldings include Ribs, Bosses, Counter bores/sinks, Inserts, Self-Tapping Screw holes, Snap Latches and Living Hinge',1,'2017-11-20 12:00:27','2017-11-20 13:02:08'),(334,'Various Links and Machine Videos',1,333,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 12:00:47','2017-11-20 12:00:47'),(335,'Photos of the inside of some example consumer products',1,333,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 12:01:14','2017-11-20 12:01:14'),(336,'ME2 Extended Notes on Various Machine Elements',1,333,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 12:01:31','2017-11-20 12:04:04'),(337,'Topic 1 - Lectures and Panopto Recordings',1,14,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 17:37:13','2017-11-20 17:37:13'),(338,'Topic 2 - Handouts',1,14,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 17:37:31','2017-11-20 17:37:31'),(339,'Topic 3 - Lab Documents',1,14,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 17:37:43','2017-11-20 17:37:43'),(340,'Selected panopto videos from previous years',1,14,0,1,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 17:38:00','2017-11-20 17:38:00'),(341,'Lecture Notes',1,278,0,5,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 18:19:14','2017-11-20 18:19:14'),(342,'Panopto recordings 2016-17 - please use these ones',1,278,0,5,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 18:19:45','2017-11-20 18:19:45'),(343,'Panopto recordings 2015-16',1,278,0,5,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 18:19:53','2017-11-20 18:19:53'),(344,'Panopto recordings 2014-15',1,278,0,5,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 18:19:59','2017-11-20 18:19:59'),(345,'Panopto recordings 2013-14',1,278,0,5,NULL,1,'2017-11-20 18:20:05','2017-11-20 18:20:05');
